Q1. What is MetaMask?
A1. MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and decentralized applications (DApps).

Q2. Why do we use MetaMask?
A2. It helps users securely store, send, and receive Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, and connect with blockchain-based applications directly from a web browser.

Q3. What are the steps to install MetaMask?
A3. 
1. Open Chrome or Firefox browser.
2. Visit https://metamask.io.
3. Click “Install MetaMask for Chrome/Firefox.”
4. Add the extension to the browser.
5. Click on the MetaMask icon to open it.

Q4. How do you create a wallet in MetaMask?
A4. 
1. Click “Create a Wallet.”
2. Set a strong password.
3. Write down the Secret Recovery Phrase (12 words).
4. Confirm the phrase and complete wallet setup.

Q5. What is a Secret Recovery Phrase?
A5. It is a 12-word phrase used to recover or restore a MetaMask wallet if it is lost or deleted.

Q6. Why is the Secret Recovery Phrase important?
A6. It is the only way to recover your funds if you lose access to your wallet. It must be kept private and secure.

Q7. What is an Ethereum address?
A7. It is a unique alphanumeric string starting with “0x” that represents your wallet’s public address on the Ethereum blockchain.

Q8. What is Ether (ETH)?
A8. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, used to pay transaction fees and interact with smart contracts.

Q9. What is “gas” in Ethereum transactions?
A9. Gas is the fee paid to miners for processing and validating transactions on the Ethereum network.

Q10. How is the transaction fee calculated?
A10. Transaction Fee = Gas Limit × Gas Price.

Q11. What happens if you set a low gas fee?
A11. The transaction might take longer to confirm or may fail if the fee is too low.

Q12. What happens if you lose your MetaMask password?
A12. You can restore access using your Secret Recovery Phrase.

Q13. Can MetaMask hold Bitcoin?
A13. No, MetaMask supports Ethereum and Ethereum-compatible blockchains (like BSC, Polygon), not Bitcoin directly.

Q14. What networks can you add to MetaMask?
A14. You can add custom networks like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.

Q15. What is the default network in MetaMask?
A15. The Ethereum Mainnet is the default network.

Q16. How do you switch between networks in MetaMask?
A16. Click the network dropdown at the top of MetaMask and select the desired network.

Q17. Can you connect MetaMask to test networks?
A17. Yes, MetaMask can connect to testnets like Goerli, Sepolia, etc., for testing smart contracts without spending real Ether.

Q18. What is the purpose of using test networks?
A18. Test networks allow developers to simulate transactions and test DApps using fake Ether without real cost.

Q19. How can you check the balance in MetaMask?
A19. After wallet creation, the balance is shown on the main dashboard. It updates automatically when Ether is received.

Q20. What is the conclusion of this experiment?
A20. MetaMask was successfully installed, a new wallet was created, and the process of spending Ether per transaction was studied.
