| What is the Fibonacci series?                        | A sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.                 |
| What are the first 10 Fibonacci numbers?             | 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34                                                      |
| What is recursion?                                   | A function calling itself to solve smaller parts of the problem.                     |
| What are base conditions?                            | Conditions to stop recursion (here, `n==0` or `n==1`).                               |
| Difference between recursion and iteration?          | Recursion uses function calls; iteration uses loops.                                 |
| Which method is faster: recursive or iterative?      | Iterative — because it avoids repeated calls and stack usage.                        |
| What is the time complexity of recursive Fibonacci?  | O(2ⁿ)                                                                                |
| What is the space complexity of iterative Fibonacci? | O(1)                                                                                 |
| Can recursion lead to memory overflow?               | Yes, due to deep call stack if `n` is large.                                         |
| What is memoization?                                 | Technique to store and reuse previous results to optimize recursion.                 |
| Why do we study Fibonacci in programming?            | It demonstrates recursion, dynamic programming, and algorithm optimization concepts. |
