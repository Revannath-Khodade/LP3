| Q1. What is Huffman coding?                                          | A lossless data compression algorithm based on character frequencies.          |
| Q2. What is the main idea behind Huffman Coding?                     | Assign shorter binary codes to frequent symbols and longer codes to rare ones. |
| Q3. What type of algorithm is it?                                    | Greedy algorithm.                                                              |
| Q4. What data structure is used?                                     | Min Heap (Priority Queue).                                                     |
| Q5. What does each node in Huffman Tree represent?                   | A character (leaf node) or combined frequency (internal node).                 |
| Q6. What is the time complexity?                                     | O(n log n)                                                                     |
| Q7. What is the space complexity?                                    | O(n)                                                                           |
| Q8. What is the output of Huffman coding?                            | A set of variable-length binary codes for each symbol.                         |
| Q9. What are real-world applications?                                | File compression (ZIP), image compression (JPEG), video (MPEG).                |
| Q10. Why is Huffman Coding called lossless?                          | Because no data is lost during compression or decompression.                   |
| Q11. What is the difference between Huffman and Run-Length Encoding? | Huffman uses frequency-based binary tree; RLE counts consecutive symbols.      |
| Q12. Can two characters have the same code?                          | No, Huffman codes are prefix-free — no code is a prefix of another.            |

Huffman Coding Algorithm

Huffman coding is a Greedy Algorithm used for data compression.
It builds a binary tree where each leaf node represents a symbol and its frequency.
The two smallest frequencies are combined iteratively until one root remains.
Codes are assigned: Left → 0, Right → 1.
The algorithm minimizes the total number of bits required.

Complexity:
Time = O(n log n), Space = O(n)
