| Q1. What is the N-Queen problem?                               | It is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. |
| Q2. What technique is used here?                               | Backtracking (a type of recursive algorithm).                                         |
| Q3. What does “backtracking” mean?                             | Trying all possibilities, and undoing (backtracking) when a partial solution fails.   |
| Q4. Why are we using sets for columns and diagonals?           | To efficiently check if a queen’s position is under attack in O(1) time.              |
| Q5. What is the base condition of recursion?                   | When all queens are successfully placed (`r == n`).                                   |
| Q6. How many possible configurations are there for N-Queens?   | It depends on N; for example, 4-Queens has 2 solutions, 8-Queens has 92.              |
| Q7. What is the time complexity?                               | O(N!).                                                                                |
| Q8. How do we represent the board?                             | As a 2D matrix using lists in Python.                                                 |
| Q9. What is the purpose of `posDiag` and `negDiag`?            | To check diagonal attacks (`r+c` and `r-c`).                                          |
| Q10. What happens when no valid position is found for a queen? | The algorithm backtracks and tries a different column in the previous row.            |

| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⏱️ Time  | **O(N!)**  | Because every queen placement leads to recursive branching |
| 💾 Space | **O(N²)**  | For the board and recursion stack                          |
