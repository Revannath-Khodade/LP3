🎯 Uber Fare Prediction – Oral Questions & Answers
🔹 1. What is the objective of this project?

👉 To predict the price (fare amount) of an Uber ride using pickup and drop-off details.

🔹 2. What type of problem is this?

👉 It’s a regression problem, because the target variable (fare_amount) is continuous.

🔹 3. What are the main steps in your project?

👉

Data Preprocessing

Outlier Detection & Removal

Feature Extraction (like distance, time, etc.)

Correlation Analysis

Model Training (Linear Regression & Random Forest)

Model Evaluation (R², RMSE, MAE)

🔹 4. How did you preprocess the dataset?

👉

Converted pickup_datetime to datetime format.

Extracted features: hour, day, month, year, day_of_week.

Calculated distance_km using the Haversine formula.

Removed invalid values (0s, negative fares, out-of-range coordinates).

🔹 5. What is the Haversine formula?

👉 It calculates the great-circle distance between two latitude/longitude points on Earth (in km).
Used to find the distance of the ride.

🔹 6. How did you identify or remove outliers?

👉

Removed rows with fare > 100 or fare ≤ 0.

Removed rows with passenger_count outside 1–6.

Removed coordinates outside NYC latitude/longitude bounds.

🔹 7. What features (independent variables) did you use?

👉
['distance_km','hour','day','month','year','passenger_count']

🔹 8. What is your target variable?

👉 fare_amount

🔹 9. What models did you use?

👉

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

🔹 10. What is Linear Regression?

👉 A model that fits a straight line relationship between features and the target using:

🔹 11. What is Random Forest Regression?

👉 An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

🔹 12. What performance metrics did you use?

👉

R² Score – how well model explains variance (closer to 1 is better).

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – measures average prediction error.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – average absolute difference between predicted and actual fares.

🔹 13. What are your results?

👉
Linear Regression:

R² = 0.72

RMSE = 4.94

MAE = 2.36

Random Forest:

R² = 0.80

RMSE = 4.17

MAE = 2.20

🔹 14. Which model performed better and why?

👉 Random Forest performed better because it can handle non-linear relationships and outliers better than Linear Regression.

🔹 15. What does a higher R² value mean?

👉 It means the model explains more variability of the target variable — better performance.

🔹 16. What does RMSE represent in this context?

👉 It shows how far the predicted fares are (on average) from the actual fares, in fare units (dollars).

🔹 17. Why did you use both models?

👉 To compare a simple model (Linear Regression) and a complex model (Random Forest) to see which gives better accuracy.

🔹 18. What is the correlation between distance and fare?

👉 Strong positive correlation — as distance increases, fare also increases.

🔹 19. Why did you extract date and time features?

👉 Because time, day, and month can influence fare due to traffic, demand, or surge pricing.

🔹 20. What conclusion can you draw from this project?

👉 Uber fare mainly depends on distance and time-related features; Random Forest gives better prediction accuracy (~80%).
