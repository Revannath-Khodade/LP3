Q1. What is the objective of this experiment?
A1. The objective is to implement K-Means clustering on the sales dataset and determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

Q2. What is clustering in machine learning?
A2. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together based on their characteristics.

Q3. What is K-Means clustering?
A3. K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that divides data into K clusters by minimizing the distance between points and their cluster centers.

Q4. What is the main idea behind K-Means?
A4. The main idea is to partition data into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Q5. What dataset is used in this experiment?
A5. The dataset used is "sales_data_sample.csv" from Kaggle, which contains sales-related information.

Q6. Which features are used for clustering?
A6. The numerical features used are QUANTITYORDERED, PRICEEACH, and SALES.

Q7. Why do we use StandardScaler before applying K-Means?
A7. StandardScaler normalizes the features to ensure all variables contribute equally to the distance calculation.

Q8. What is the purpose of the Elbow Method?
A8. The Elbow Method helps determine the optimal number of clusters (k) by finding the point where the SSE (sum of squared errors) curve starts to flatten.

Q9. What does SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) mean?
A9. SSE measures how close data points are to their cluster centers. A lower SSE indicates tighter clusters.

Q10. What range of k values was tested in the Elbow Method?
A10. The range of k tested was from 1 to 10.

Q11. How many clusters were found optimal from the elbow plot?
A11. The optimal number of clusters was chosen as 4.

Q12. What function in scikit-learn is used for K-Means clustering?
A12. The function used is `KMeans()` from `sklearn.cluster`.

Q13. What parameter in KMeans defines the number of clusters?
A13. The parameter `n_clusters` defines the number of clusters (K value).

Q14. What is the role of the random_state parameter?
A14. It ensures reproducibility of results by controlling random number generation.

Q15. What do the cluster labels represent?
A15. Cluster labels represent the group each data point belongs to after clustering.

Q16. What is the output of the algorithm in this experiment?
A16. The output shows the sales records with an additional column “Cluster” indicating the cluster number.

Q17. Is K-Means supervised or unsupervised learning?
A17. K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

Q18. What are the advantages of K-Means?
A18. It is simple, fast, and works well for large datasets with well-separated clusters.

Q19. What are the disadvantages of K-Means?
A19. It requires the number of clusters (K) to be known in advance and is sensitive to outliers.

Q20. What conclusion can you draw from this experiment?
A20. The sales data was successfully grouped into 4 meaningful clusters, helping in better sales analysis and customer segmentation.
